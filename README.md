# Codex Skills Repo

This repo is the canonical source for my Codex skills.

The Codex app discovers skills via `~/.codex/skills`, which is a symlink to
`~/src/codex-skills/skills`. Edit skills here and the app picks them up
immediately.

Layout:
- `skills/`: one folder per skill (each contains `SKILL.md` and optional assets)
